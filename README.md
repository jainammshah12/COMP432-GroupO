# Image Classification Model Training and Testing

## High-level description/presentation of the project
The rise of Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV) has transformed multiple sectors, leveraging visual data interpretation. This revolution finds application in diverse fields such as autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and facial recognition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) play a pivotal role in processing image data, excelling in tasks like object recognition. Yet, challenges persist, including adaptability to variations, limited data for training, and model interpretability, necessitating robust CNN-based CV systems. Our project aims to build a resilient CV model using CNN for precise classification of colorectal and prostate cancer tissues, as well as animal face recognition. The project involves dataset processing, model architecture design, training, and analysis, striving to enhance CNN-based visual analysis and advance the field of CV, offering a solid base for future research and practical applications. To achieve this, we have selected three datasets, each characterized by distinct image formats and classes. The project is divided into two tasks, the first involving training a CNN model on Dataset 1, and the second applying pre-trained CNN encoders and ImageNet CNN encoders to Dataset 2 and Dataset 3 for feature extraction. The data will be processed, cleaned, and split into training and testing sets, with performance evaluation based on several metrics, including accuracy and confusion matrices. The team will conduct a comprehensive analysis, utilizing t-SNE visualization and implementing both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to assess and compare results. Our study is expected to validate deep learning models, facilitating knowledge transfer across applications and providing practical insights for image classification and deep learning applications.

## Requirements to run your Python code (libraries, etc)
The parts of this project are dissected into several Jupyter Notebooks. For them to run successfully, you would need to run them individually on Google Colab or the infrastructure available on your PC to be able to run Jupyter Notebooks (Anaconda Navigator installed). The reason the project is dissected is due to limited resources and processing power which would result in collapsing or crashing the entire project. You would have to install Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyTorch, and Sci-Kit Learn in order to successfully run the code as available.

## Instruction on how to train/validate your model
If you are using Google Colab, please ensure that the datasets are on your Google Drive with the appropriate name to bring the best possible results. If on the other hand you are running it locally, please ensure that the files are at an appropriate place and you mention the address on the code for it to run successfully.

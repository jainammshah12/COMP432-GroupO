# Image Classification Model Training and Testing

The rise of Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV) has transformed multiple sectors, leveraging visual data interpretation. This revolution finds application in diverse fields such as autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and facial recognition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) play a pivotal role in processing image data, excelling in tasks like object recognition. Yet, challenges persist, including adaptability to variations, limited data for training, and model interpretability, necessitating robust CNN-based CV systems. Our project aims to build a resilient CV model using CNN for precise classification of colorectal and prostate cancer tissues, as well as animal face recognition. The project involves dataset processing, model architecture design, training, and analysis, striving to enhance CNN-based visual analysis and advance the field of CV, offering a solid base for future research and practical applications. To achieve this, we have selected three datasets, each characterized by distinct image formats and classes. The project is divided into two tasks, the first involving training a CNN model on Dataset 1, and the second applying pre-trained CNN encoders to Dataset 2 and Dataset 3 for feature extraction. The data will be processed, cleaned, and split into training and testing sets, with performance evaluation based on several metrics, including accuracy and confusion matrices. The team will conduct a comprehensive analysis, utilizing t-SNE visualization and implementing both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to assess and compare results. Our study is expected to validate deep learning models, facilitating knowledge transfer across applications and providing practical insights for image classification and deep learning applications.
